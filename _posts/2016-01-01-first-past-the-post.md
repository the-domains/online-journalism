It has been a wait -- a long wait, but then the Grid is finally here. I chose to get going on it on this day, the 1st of January, 2016\. There, this is the first time I typed 2016\. I'll have to do that a thousand times or more or the next 365 days. 

What's in store? Quite a bit remains unknown. What I do know right now it that I am in the vortex of "The Move". I head back to Bangalore shortly, bag and baggage, alone, from Madras. I then have to leave for New Delhi. For the first time I head to Delhi with the intent to stay on. I will join work mid month. 

A new chapter is the cliche that comes to mind. Ah, I used it! A whole new experience that not just poses the challenge of adjusting to a new city and  that too the National Capital, but also a new job that is quite exciting and challenging. I'm looking forward to that. 

I'm Subhash Rai, 47, and I'm an online journalist.
