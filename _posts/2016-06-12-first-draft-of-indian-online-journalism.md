The journey has taken me from Bangalore to Abu Dhabi, Chennai and now to New Delhi. A happy ride, but in many ways a difficult one too. 

I've been where online journalism was a bit-player in a newsroom'ss scheme of things, leave alone what business thought of it.

Now it is all the rage, of course. We've been ensconced bang in the middle of newsrooms. There are pundits via for their version of new media to be the norm. 

There are those more reticent on the sidelines, waiting to allow themselves to be lead. I've heard that pervading fear old hacks of the new media, but it's hasn't been so obvious to me. But I guess they are willing to engage with it, if it wasn't an imposition. The battle is to engage, to encourage and to collaborate with those very masters of the old art of journalism.
